# React 2048-Game

The famous 2048 game made in react, with a personal touch and animations


## Step-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your React Environment:

* Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
* Create a new React app using Create React App: npx create-react-app react-2048-game.
* Navigate into your newly created project directory: cd react-2048-game.

### 2. Structure Your Project:

* Organize your project files and folders as needed. 
* Common directories include src/components, src/helpers, src/assets, etc.
* Create necessary components such as Board, Cell, Tile, etc., inside the src/components directory.

### 3. Implement the Game Logic:

* Define the game logic in the Board component or create helper functions in the helpers directory.
* Implement functions to handle user inputs, move tiles, merge tiles, generate new tiles, check for game over, etc.

### 4. Style Your Game:

* Design the game interface using CSS or a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.
* Style components such as Cell and Tile to visually represent the game board and tiles.

### 5. Implement Game Mechanics:

* Add event listeners to handle user inputs (e.g., arrow key presses) for tile movements.
* Update the game state accordingly and re-render the board after each move.

### 6. Test Your Game:

* Test your game thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
* Check for edge cases, such as winning conditions, losing conditions, tile merging, etc.
